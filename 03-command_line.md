### Q1.  Cheat Sheet of Commands  

Here's a list of items with which you should be familiar:  
* show current working directory path
* creating a directory
* deleting a directory
* creating a file using `touch` command
* deleting a file
* renaming a file
* listing hidden files
* copying a file from one directory to another

Make a cheat sheet for yourself: a list of at least **ten** commands and what they do.  (Use the 8 items above and add a couple of your own.)  

* pwd - show current working directory path
* mkdir NAME 					 				:creating a directory
* rm -R NAME 					 				:deleting a directory (permanent)
* touch NAME 					 				:creating a file using `touch` command
* rm NAME		 					 				:deleting a file
* mv OLD_NAME NEW_NAME 				:renaming a file
* ls -a 							 				:listing hidden files
* cp FILE_PATH NEW_FILE_PATH	:copying a file from one directory to another
* cd ../											:move up one folder level

What do the following commands do:  
`ls`     : lists all files and directories in the current directory.
`ls -a`  : lists all files and directories (including hidden files) in the current directory.
`ls -l`  : lists all files as a table
`ls -lh` : lists all files, their size, and the datetime last modified 
`ls -lah`: lists all files (including hidden files), their size, and the datetime last modified  
`ls -t`  : lists all files sorted by time and date
`ls -Glp`: lists all the files and directories giving their size and ordered by datetime last modified

### Q3.  More List Files in Unix  

Explore these other [ls options](http://www.techonthenet.com/unix/basic/ls.php) and pick 5 of your favorites:

*ls -d :lists all directories
*ls -m :lists all names as csv
*ls -p : displays all directories to end with "/"
*ls -R : displays the subdirectories as well (however, beware not to use this at the very top level of the directory)
*ls -u : displays files by access time

### Q4.  Xargs   

What does `xargs` do? Give an example of how to use it.

xargs repeats an operation on a list of files or, more generally speaking, a collection of multiple items.

For example, if I wanted to print out the content of several .txt files, I would use the following code:

ls *.txt | xargs cat
